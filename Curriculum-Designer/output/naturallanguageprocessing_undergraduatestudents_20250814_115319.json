Build a simple N-gram language model and calculate perplexity. Apply Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF for text representation.\n        *   **Assesses:** Learning Outcomes from Week 1 & 2.\n    *   **Assignment 2: Word Embeddings & Traditional Classification (15%)**\n        *   **Due:** End of Week 5\n        *   **Description:** Utilize pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe) for a text task. Implement and evaluate a traditional machine learning classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes or SVM) for a text classification problem (e.g., sentiment analysis or spam detection), including feature engineering and evaluation metrics.\n        *   **Assesses:** Learning Outcomes from Week 3, 4 (conceptual understanding of parsing might inform features), & 5.\n    *   **Assignment 3: Introduction to Neural Networks for Text (10%)**\n        *   **Due:** End of Week 7\n        *   **Description:** Build and train a simple feedforward neural network (MLP) or a basic RNN/LSTM model using a deep learning framework (e.g., Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch) for a text classification or sequence labeling task (e.g., simple POS tagging).\n        *   **Assesses:** Learning Outcomes from Week 6 & 7.\n\n### 3. Mid-Term Exam (20% of Final Grade)\n\n*   **Purpose:** A comprehensive assessment of theoretical understanding and conceptual grasp of the first half of the course material.\n*   **Timing:** Administered during Week 5, covering material from Week 1 to Week 4.\n*   **Format:** A timed, closed-book exam consisting of:\n    *   Definitions and explanations of key NLP concepts.\n    *   Problem-solving questions (e.g., calculating N-gram probabilities, interpreting TF-IDF values, drawing simple parse trees, explaining HMM intuition).\n    *   Short answer questions requiring comparison or critique of different techniques.\n*   **Topics Covered:** All topics from Module 1 (Foundations) and Module 2 (Traditional NLP Models) up to Week 4, including: Text Preprocessing, Language Modeling, N-grams, Perplexity, BoW, TF-IDF, POS Tagging, Word Embeddings, Syntactic Parsing (Constituency & Dependency).\n\n### 4. Final Project (30% of Final Grade)\n\n*   **Purpose:** The capstone assessment, requiring students to integrate knowledge and skills acquired throughout the entire course to solve a significant NLP problem. It fosters independent research, problem-solving, and critical evaluation.\n*   **Timing:** Project proposal due Week 5. Final project submission (code and report) due at the end of Week 8.\n*   **Format:** Students will work individually or in small groups (2-3 students) on a self-selected or instructor-approved NLP project. Deliverables include:\n    *   **Project Proposal (5% of project grade, part of final project score):** A brief document outlining the chosen problem, proposed methodology, data sources, and expected outcomes.\n    *   **Code Repository (e.g., GitHub):** Well-documented, reproducible code implementing the NLP solution.\n    *   **Technical Report (20% of project grade):** A comprehensive report detailing:\n        *   Problem definition and motivation.\n        *   Literature review (brief).\n        *   Data collection and preprocessing.\n        *   Methodology (models used, experimental setup).\n        *   Results and analysis (including appropriate evaluation metrics).\n        *   Discussion of limitations and future work.\n        *   **Crucially, a dedicated section on ethical considerations** related to the project's data, models, and potential applications (addressing Week 8's ethical NLP topics).\n    *   **Optional Presentation/Demo (5% of project grade):** A short presentation or demonstration of the project's functionality and key findings (if time permits or for larger classes, a subset of projects may be presented).\n*   **Topics & Learning Outcomes Assessed:** All learning outcomes from the entire 8-week curriculum, with a strong emphasis on applying modern NLP techniques (including deep learning where appropriate) and critically evaluating their societal impact. Examples include advanced sentiment analysis, text summarization, question answering, chatbot development, or bias detection.",
