Add a method to search for a product by ID.\n\n### Week 8: Applying OOP: Design Principles and Practical Project\n\n*   **Lecture Notes:**\n    *   **\"Consolidating OOP Pillars\"**: Comprehensive review and synthesis of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism with advanced examples.\n    *   **\"SOLID Principles: Building Maintainable and Scalable Systems\"**: Detailed explanation of each principle (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) with real-world analogies and code patterns.\n    *   **\"Introduction to Common Design Patterns: Singleton and Factory Method\"**: Brief overview of their purpose, structure, and simple use cases.\n    *   **\"Refactoring for OOP Principles\"**: Techniques and examples for improving existing code quality by adhering to OOP and SOLID principles.\n*   **Code Examples:**\n    *   `SRPExample.java`: Before and after refactoring a class violating Single Responsibility Principle (e.g., a `ReportGenerator` class also handling data fetching and printing).\n    *   `OCPExample.java`: Demonstrating Open/Closed Principle with a `Shape` interface and `AreaCalculator` class that can be extended without modification.\n    *   `LSPExample.java`: Illustrating Liskov Substitution Principle with `Rectangle` and `Square` classes.\n    *   `ISPExample.java`: How Interface Segregation Principle leads to smaller, more specific interfaces.\n    *   `DIPExample.java`: Dependency Inversion Principle using interfaces for dependencies (e.g., `Logger` interface and `ConsoleLogger` implementation).\n    *   `SingletonPattern.java`: Basic implementation of the Singleton design pattern.\n    *   `FactoryMethodPattern.java`: Simple factory for creating different types of `Vehicle` objects based on input.\n*   **Case Studies/Exercises:**\n    *   **Mini-Project**: \"Simple E-commerce Order Processing System\"\n        *   **Requirements**:\n            *   Classes: `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`, `ShoppingCart`.\n            *   `Product`: (id, name, price, stock) - Encapsulated.\n            *   `Customer`: (id, name, email) - Encapsulated.\n            *   `Order`: Contains `Customer` and a `List` of `Product`s. Calculate total, apply discounts.\n            *   `ShoppingCart`: Add/remove products, view cart, checkout.\n        *   **OOP Principles to Apply**:\n            *   **Encapsulation**: All class fields private with getters/setters.\n            *   **Inheritance**: Optional: Different types of products (e.g., `ElectronicsProduct`, `BookProduct`) inheriting from `Product`.\n            *   **Polymorphism**: If using product types, use polymorphism when calculating total order price.\n            *   **Abstraction**: An `OrderProcessor` interface or abstract class.\n            *   **Exception Handling**: Handle `InsufficientStockException`, `ProductNotFoundException`.\n            *   **Collections**: Use `ArrayList` for `ShoppingCart` items, `HashMap` for product catalog.\n            *   **SOLID**: Design `OrderProcessor` to be open for extension but closed for modification (OCP). Ensure `Product` class follows SRP.\n        *   **Deliverables**: UML class diagram, well-commented Java code, a brief report explaining how OOP and SOLID principles were applied.\n    *   **Refactoring Challenge**: Given a provided \"bad code\" snippet (e.g., a monolithic class with many responsibilities), identify violations of SRP and OCP, and refactor it into a cleaner, more modular design.\n\n---\n\n## External Resources for 'OOPs in Java'\n\n### Books:\n*   **A Beginner's Guide to oops in java**: This book is recommended for undergraduate students as it covers fundamental OOPs concepts in Java, aligning with the curriculum's target audience and initial modules.\n\n### Videos:\n*   **Introduction to oops in java on Khan Academy**: Khan Academy videos are known for their clear explanations and visual aids, making them suitable supplementary material for undergraduate students learning introductory OOPs concepts.\n\n### Websites:\n*   **Official documentation website for oops in java**: The official documentation is an invaluable resource for any Java programmer, providing authoritative and comprehensive information on all aspects of the language, including OOPs. It's essential for undergraduate students to learn to consult this resource for in-depth understanding and reference."
