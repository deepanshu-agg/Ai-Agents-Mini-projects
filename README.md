# 🤖 AI Agents — Mini Projects & Assignments

This repository showcases a collection of **AI Agent–based assignments** completed as part of my **AI Agents course**.
Each mini project is organized in its own directory with a detailed README explaining its **goals, design, setup, and usage**.

These projects demonstrate how autonomous or semi-autonomous agents can be applied to real-world problem-solving and creative tasks.
